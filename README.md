# midi_generator
Python code that can generates MIDI patterns. This is a proposal for a python library to make .mid files using given input. Note that, the codes are not finished and represents an idea to contribute and finalize the work. 

This code generates a MIDI pattern with a single track that contains a series of random notes in the given scale. The notes are added to the track at random intervals and with random durations, creating a basic rhythm. The pattern is then saved to a MIDI file.
