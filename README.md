# random_midi_generator
Python code that can generate random MIDI patterns
This code generates a MIDI pattern with a single track that contains a series of random notes in the given scale. The notes are added to the track at random intervals and with random durations, creating a basic rhythm. The pattern is then saved to a MIDI file.
